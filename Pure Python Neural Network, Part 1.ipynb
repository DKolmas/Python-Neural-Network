    "This note is the first one out of a few next notes desribing implementation and analysis of pure python neural network. The purpose to do this exercise was to grasp a hands on experience with implementation detials as I am moving now to Tensor Flow (TF). TF is a great tool but it is good to understand basic concepts first. \n",

    "At the beggining I planned to prepare just one note but over time it became clear it would be way to much content to make it digestible even for very stuborn and motivated person.\n",

    "In this note I will describe:\n",
    " * motivation for choosing a specific architecture of nerual network\n",
    " * architecture of neural network implemented in python\n",
    " * data samples used for learning and testing\n",
    " * two different approaches used in implementation of backrpoagation algorithm\n",
    " * three methods of weights initiaizations used in analysis\n",

    "In the next note I will focus on performance analysis of trained network. I will provide many figures and complement it with results discussion. Finnaly I will formulate my conclussions."

    "While attending Udacity online course in 2017, **[Deel Learninig Foundation](https://eu.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101)**, I could see a greate possibilities using Deep Learning (via TensorFlow) in different tasks: image recognition, automatic translator engine, ... These task involved complex network architectures: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recuent Neural Networks (RNN) (and some flavors of it), and my favorit General Adversial Netowkrs (GANs). \n",
    "\n",
    "This course was great. It showed me how to build quickly powerfool tools using Tensor Flow to do very complex task. It was very motivating course and acutally it further encoured me to do more. I left the course with TensorFlow hands on experience and good overview of what deep learing can do for me.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also in my professional life I use Reinforced Learning where Neural Netowork is part of the whole framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of the above is more about applications of deep networks. At some point I decided to hold on for a \"moment\" and spent time to uderstand better some theory. And that is why I have created the note on pure python neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far I can see already benefits of investing my time in this work. I can better understand NN related content I read therefore spending less time on digesting them (for eample nice explanation on [softmax in TensorFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34240703/whats-the-difference-between-softmax-and-softmax-cross-entropy-with-logits)). I can also further expand my knowledge. Shortly I plan to focus on understanding a concept of **Actor-Critic Algorithms**."
